        "<p>We generally accept that our minds are able to produce dreams as we sleep. These dreams may be vivid, but they’re not real. We say that as we are the only ones experiencing them.</p><p>Reality is thus the empirical world that our mind dips into when we are not sleeping.</p><p>Meanwhile, most of us agree that life is more than the objective. In fact, most of what truly matters to us is subjective; our ideas, values, identities, beliefs, opinions, and motivations—all this is in our minds. In our dreams, a boundless landscape where the laws of nature no longer apply. We may think of anything, and it’s right there before our mind’s eye.</p><p>Many of us have trouble grasping the concept of infinity, while easily accepting that nothing lies beyond the end of our subjective dreams. Our imagination is simply enclosed in a nothingness from which ideas arise and fall. Like a sound that grows and fades into silence.</p><p>Vibration and tranquility. Motion and stillness.</p><blockquote>'Nothing happens until something moves.' ― Albert Einstein</blockquote><p>Our sciences show that the material world isn’t anything like how we perceive it. Colors, sounds, smells, flavors, and tactile sensations are but truncated interpretations rendered by our body. They’re translations of vast amounts of fluctuating energies that vibrate at astonishing rates into what we experience as an impression of reality.</p><p>Reality has laws, such as gravity. 99.9999999% of this world is said to be empty space. By empty, we mean large distances between atoms. Going deeper, it’s been shown that the emptiness isn’t even empty per se but filled with a wide variety of non-atom particles and fields.</p><p>If we then consider that our bodies consist of only 0.0000001% conventional matter, energy, that is swirling at bewildering rates. Reality is a porous mist of almost nothing from which a perceiving consciousness emerges.</p><p>Then, when this whirlwind goes into the specific vibratory state called sleep, it somehow goes into a world that is no longer part of this materialistic swirling chaos that gave birth to it.</p><p>Where does it go?</p><p>Somehow, this swirling mist enters a state where it vibrates in a way as to generate internal resonances that evoke worlds within it that would be impossible beyond it. Something unreal is now being generated and played out by a cloud of energy in reality.</p><p>How does a vibrating cloud, that adheres to the laws of nature, resonate in such a way as to generate experiences that defy these laws?</p><p>The answer to this question is likely trivial. However, what strikes me as profoundly important, is what this means to our relationship to our imagination. It may unlock a more creative way to reason about our conscious experience. Myth becomes ordinary. Synthesizing ideas in our minds and transmitting them to others; is magic. It’s literally spell weaving. We pull realms out of our void and share them in a process that reshapes the physical world.</p><p>That is the essence of alchemy, and it’s atheistic. <br /> Mysticism is the elusive science of our self-aware and creative consciousness. <br /> Myth is a syntax for grasping the fullness of reality. <br />Our imagination is as vital to reality as anything, and so is the study of its evolution and the development of it for the future.</p><blockquote>'If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, Infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thro' narrow chinks of his cavern.' ― William Blake, The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</blockquote><p>Humanity is tirelessly pushing to manifest our collective dreams; mirroring ourselves through art and technology. Like angels we swirl in a mental realm of infinite potential, desperately trying to pull reality closer.</p><p>We know that dreams are as real as our love and passion. <br />It’s the only thing that is truly ours.</p><p>All we need is to close our eyes, focus, and we’re there.</p><p>Love and light, <br /> Michel Iseneld</p>"
