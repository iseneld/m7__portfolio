        "<p>I remember writing in my journal over a decade ago, I think it was about this time of year. I was contemplating the implications for our sense of agency as it's juxtaposed with the mechanistic neuron system that is our brain.</p>",
        "<p>Since then, I've not only had an unwavering understanding that free will is an illusion, but also that I can't even imagine how a non-deterministic free system could exist.</p>",
        "<p>This has resulted in many interesting conversations over the years. A few individuals find the notion intriguing, most are provoked into emotional responses that disables further conversation.</p>",
        "<p>Primarily, it seems to have been an issue of (1) not wanting to be 'a robot and (2) wanting 'bad people' to be held 'responsible' for their actions. Both cases reject the idea as it doesn't align with what they want to be true, or that it would be scary if it was.</p>",
        "<p>This has made me realise that our society hasn't been ready for this healing potion, yet. Now, however, the tides are turning as science grinds what we want the world to be like, down into a powder of what it actually is.</p>",
        "<p>So, I want to plant this flag here so that I can refer back to these days when I am old and gray, sharing some trivia with my grand children about a time when this common sense notion was still wraught with taboo.</p>",
