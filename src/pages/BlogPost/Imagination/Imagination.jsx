          <h2>Imagi&shy;nation is the key</h2>
          <p>
            We generally accept that our minds are able to produce dreams as we
            sleep. These dreams may be vivid, but they’re not real. We say that
            as we are the only ones experiencing them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reality is thus the empirical world that our mind dips into when we
            are not sleeping.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, most of us agree that life is more than the objective. In
            fact, most of what truly matters to us is subjective; our ideas,
            values, identities, beliefs, opinions, and motivations—all this is
            in our minds. In our dreams, a boundless landscape where the laws of
            nature no longer apply. We may think of anything, and it’s right
            there before our mind’s eye.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many of us have trouble grasping the concept of infinity, while
            easily accepting that nothing lies beyond the end of our subjective
            dreams. Our imagination is simply enclosed in a nothingness from
            which ideas arise and fall. Like a sound that grows and fades into
            silence.
          </p>
          <p>Vibration and tranquility. Motion and stillness.</p>
          <blockquote>
            'Nothing happens until something moves.' ― Albert Einstein
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Our sciences show that the material world isn’t anything like how we
            perceive it. Colors, sounds, smells, flavors, and tactile sensations
            are but truncated interpretations rendered by our body. They’re
            translations of vast amounts of fluctuating energies that vibrate at
            astonishing rates into what we experience as an impression of
            reality.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reality has laws, such as gravity. 99.9999999% of this world is said
            to be empty space. By empty, we mean large distances between atoms.
            Going deeper, it’s been shown that the emptiness isn’t even empty
            per se but filled with a wide variety of non-atom particles and
            fields.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we then consider that our bodies consist of only 0.0000001%
            conventional matter, energy, that is swirling at bewildering rates.
            Reality is a porous mist of almost nothing from which a perceiving
            consciousness emerges.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, when this whirlwind goes into the specific vibratory state
            called sleep, it somehow goes into a world that is no longer part of
            this materialistic swirling chaos that gave birth to it.
          </p>
          <p>Where does it go?</p>
          <p>
            Somehow, this swirling mist enters a state where it vibrates in a
            way as to generate internal resonances that evoke worlds within it
            that would be impossible beyond it. Something unreal is now being
            generated and played out by a cloud of energy in reality.
          </p>
          <p>
            How does a vibrating cloud, that adheres to the laws of nature,
            resonate in such a way as to generate experiences that defy these
            laws?
          </p>
          <p>
            The answer to this question is likely trivial. However, what strikes
            me as profoundly important, is what this means to our relationship
            to our imagination. It may unlock a more creative way to reason
            about our conscious experience. Myth becomes ordinary. Synthesizing
            ideas in our minds and transmitting them to others; is magic. It’s
            literally spell weaving. We pull realms out of our void and share
            them in a process that reshapes the physical world.
          </p>
          <p>
            That is the essence of alchemy, and it’s atheistic. <br /> Mysticism
            is the elusive science of our self-aware and creative consciousness.{" "}
            <br /> Myth is a syntax for grasping the fullness of reality. <br />
            Our imagination is as vital to reality as anything, and so is the
            study of its evolution and the development of it for the future.

          <blockquote>
            'If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear
            to man as it is, Infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he
            sees all things thro' narrow chinks of his cavern.' ― William Blake,
            The Marriage of Heaven and Hell
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Humanity is tirelessly pushing to manifest our collective dreams;
            mirroring ourselves through art and technology. Like angels we swirl
            in a mental realm of infinite potential, desperately trying to pull
            reality closer.
          </p>
          <p>
            We know that dreams are as real as our love and passion. <br />
            It’s the only thing that is truly ours.
          </p>
          <p>
            All we need is to close our eyes, focus, and we’re there. <br />
            In the generative dimension. <br />
            Lush and eternal.
          </p>
