          <h2>Education is not universal.</h2>
          <h2>
            What if we made it more inclusive, like a free open-world online
            multiplayer game?
          </h2>
          <details>
            <summary>The brief:</summary>
            <h4>
              Your task is to pick a shortcoming in education and redesign it!
            </h4>
            <p>
              What one element could be improved so that students today can
              become more engaged, curious or stimulated or so that learning in
              general could include more emotion, purpose, meaning and/or
              feeling? How could the learning environment be changed to reduce
              inequality or discrimination? It could be a 5-minute fix that any
              instructor can incorporate or an entire redesign of the public
              education system.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Identify a shortcoming that you think you can improve.</li>
              <li>
                Once you have identified the shortcoming, explore what you can
                do to change the status quo and hack it.
              </li>
              <li>
                Create a unique method or solution that actively resolves the
                shortcoming. Present your solution as your Application Task.
              </li>
            </ol>

          <p>
            Picture this: we register to an application from anywhere in the
            world. It then asks us: What do we want to learn?
          </p>
          <p>
            Like Twitter asking us about our interests when registering, so does
            this educational platform, matching us with resources, quizzes,
            tasks, communities and job opportunities—all within the application.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, we pick a topic, and the app presents a variety of content. If
            we do not find it interesting, we can go back and try something
            else. A part of this system’s charm is the opportunity to learn many
            different things and creating our unique skillset.
          </p>
          <p>
            We then start learning by reading, watching, listening and finishing
            quizzes and tasks. All this earns us experience points with
            occasional level-ups that unlock new educational content,
            assignments and challenges.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once our skill level has increased enough on a topic, we can look at
            the low-level tasks and propose improvements. We submit our
            suggestions for peer review by other skilled students who may up or
            downvote. If our suggestion is appreciated, we earn more points and
            improve the overall education quality.
          </p>
          <p>
            This way, the system becomes open-source and could be built on a
            decentralised blockchain system, making it open, neutral and
            permanent. We would then not need programmes nor degrees. Instead,
            we could have reward systems, learning paths, achievements and skill
            levels neatly summarised on our public profile.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let us look at a traditional master’s degree. It requires five years
            of studies with, let us say, 50 weeks of annual activity. That means
            we go to school for 250 weeks to earn a degree. If we further assume
            that we must complete ten tasks per week, that adds up to 2500 tasks
            for a degree.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this new platform, education becomes a more nuanced and
            open-ended learning process. Everything we learn adds continuously
            to our profile.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jobs are unlocked as we improve our skills. Companies pay us to
            learn about their product or add paid tasks to a global marketplace.
            The former can also lead to the latter as they pay us to learn to
            help them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both local and web-based jobs could be submitted. We build a
            reputation as an employee by doing a good job and employers by being
            fair. This system creates a market where meeting the needs of others
            is central.
          </p>
          <p>
            By issuing transactions with cryptocurrency, anyone in the world
            could receive funds instantly. All they need to get started is the
            faintest verbal skill to find the appropriate content that improves
            and progressively opens their possibilities. This way, young
            individuals in developing countries could educate themselves and
            make careers using only a smartphone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, by allowing students to be pseudonymous, there would be
            no gender or skin colour. Instead, we could show only our knowledge
            and reputation within the community.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pseudonymity opens up borderless cooperation without prejudice. As
            we solve tasks in teams, we share experience points and level up our
            teamwork stats.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although global networking would be made more accessible, local
            institutions could still be valuable. Companies such as Hyper Island
            could provide facilities where users meet, learn and earn together.
            They could provide their subscribers with lectures, rental gear and
            an inspiring environment. The education, however, is available for
            free to anyone through the application.
          </p>
          <p>
            After spending a couple of months, years or decades being active on
            this application, we would have a public profile that reflects our
            competence and interests. There is no bottom limit to when someone
            can start exploring this application.
          </p>
          <p>
            In essence, it would be no different from a regular elementary
            school or university in terms of what can we teach online.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, instead of keeping the knowledge as a centralized secret
            for admitted students only, anyone is welcome to learn, teach and
            earn.
